This website is an adjunct to the INDOLOGY online discussion forum for  Classical South Asian studies.  The forum was founded in 1990 by Dominik Wujastyk as a medium for exchange and debate by university-level  research scholars. Since July 2001 the forum has been managed by a  committee of active Indologists.
