The *Compendium of Suśruta* (*Suśrutasaṃhitā*) is a world classic of ancient 
medicine, comparable in age and importance to the Greek Hippocratic Corpus and 
the Chinese *Huangdi Neijing*. It is a substantial treatise of 186 chapters, written in the Sanskrit 
language, that presents a systematic, scholarly form of medicine for diagnosing 
and treating the many ailments that patients presented in South Asia two 
thousand years ago. It is one of the founding treatises of Ayurveda, "The Knowledge of Life", the 
indigenous medical system of South Asia, and it still informs indigenous 
medical practice in India and Ayurvedic complementary and alternative 
medical practice internationally. The *Compendium* is perhaps most famous 
amongst historians of medicine for its passages describing remarkable forms 
of surgery some of which were witnessed by British surgeons in India in the 
eighteenth century and subsequently formed the basis of certain types of 
facial reconstruction as practised even today.

The *Compendium of Suśruta* has a complicated and flawed history of 
transmission and scribal corruption. The poor state of the text creates 
challenges not only for the historian of medicine but also for patients who are 
still treated by Ayurvedic doctors today who use *The Compendium* as a living 
medical textbook.

A stunning discovery in 2007 brought a new excitement and opportunities to 
the subject. The Nepal-German Manuscript Cataloguing Project at Hamburg 
University announced the discovery in the Kathmandu library of Kaiser 
Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana (1892--1964), a former Prime Minister of Nepal, 
of a palm-leaf manuscript of The Compendium of Suśruta that is reliably 
datable to 878 CE. UNESCO has added this manuscript to the "Memory of the 
World" register. This manuscript pushes our physical evidence for the treatise 
back by a millennium. Detailed study of this thousand-year-old manuscript 
during [The Suśruta Project](http://sushrutaproject.org) (2020-2024) revealed a much earlier stage of the work's 
textual development and has placed our historical understanding of this Asian 
medical classic on a new foundation. 

This recent research has also revealed that at some time after the ninth 
century, an aggressive campaign of editorial revision was applied to *The* 
*Compendium*, pervasively altering the text and generating the vulgate 
version that we know from printed editions today.  The present project will 
undertake detailed work based on much wider manuscript evidence in order 
to map the textual evolution of this Classic in time and across the local 
regions of South and SE Asia using traditional historical and philological 
methods coupled with the methods of digital humanities. The 
latter methods will allow fine control over the expected large volume of 
differential data between the manuscripts, and enable the generation of 
historical trees of relationship. The project will also transcribe and edit 
previously unstudied medieval commentaries on *The Compendium* including 
the surviving fragments of commentaries by Jejjaṭa (fl. ca. 800), Candraṭa (fl. 
ca. 900), and Gayadāsa (fl. ca. 1000).  A strong hypothesis is that Candraṭa in 
particular was a key contributor to the rewriting of *The Compendium,* but this 
needs to be tested through detailed study.  None of these commentaries has 
previously been published or studied.

The goal is to develop a fresh understanding of ancient South Asian medicine 
based on the new evidence. We will be especially focussed on highlighting 
the textual and doctrinal differences between *The Compendium* as it existed 
in 878 CE and the later vulgate version. Project outcomes will include critical 
editions and translations of the main text and its commentaries, studies of 
the transmission of scientific ideas within South Asia as well as to China and 
South East Asia, and outreach to contemporary consumers of indigenous 
medicine.
